### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darius Teodor Rus 

I am a currently a graduate of the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, from the Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology college.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my programming skills. 
        This, in a very broad way, means everything from algorithmic thinking for diverse problems to different programming languages and frameworks.

    Because of my particular interest in games, interfaces and functional programming I created a few simple games such as Snake (basic JS), Pong (Java), MazeGame (Java),              Sudoku(Java). 
    Currently I'm working on better versions and other games such as a platformer.

    In terms of problem solving, I regularly solve coding problems on CodeWars, an online coding practice site for all programmers where you can learn various programming              languages and develop a good understanding of algorithms and problem solving.
    This is the link to my profile there https://www.codewars.com/users/Barnnabass.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to be more attain more expertise in known languages and frameworks (Java/C#, JS/TS, C/C++, NoSQL/SQL, HTML/CSS, React/Vue/NestJs) and learn and master some new ones (Python) or learn popular frameworks (Spring, React).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on big and complex projects to further improve my programming skills. While web development is a familiar domain I'm open to diversity in terms of workplace tasks.
