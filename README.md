### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darius Teodor Rus 

I am a currently a graduate of the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, from the Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology college.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my programming skills. 
        This, in a very broad way, means everything from algorithmic thinking for diverse problems to different programming languages and frameworks.

    As a personal project I developed a web application that hadnles the booking, registering and managing of a venue, much in the field of alreaady existent travel solutions websites such as Booking.com or Airbnb, but with additional functionalities and flows to improve uppon the experience. I implemented this project using React, with hooks and Material UI as a helper library, for the frontend and NestJs for the backend, the appplication using TypeScript fullstack. For the database solution I opted for MongoDB for a more streamlined and faster data handling in the all to simple document format.

    The objetice of this project was to develop a web solution for booking and managing a location where the client, looking for an accomodation, and the owner can rate each other on some relevant metrics to the quality of services offered and the overall experience. The implementation also contains much of the expected functionalities that one would see on some existing travelling websites such as Booking.com or Airbnb, for example searches and filters based on multiple information related to a venue.
The application uses for it's client side implementation TypeScript, React as a framework, using React hooks and functional components, alongside with Material UI as a helper library for frontend development. To implement the server we used TypeScript again and NestJs as framework, this giving us built in structuring of the backend logic on layers and built in dependency injection.
    
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to be more attain more expertise in known languages and frameworks (Java/C#, JS/TS, C/C++, NoSQL/SQL, HTML/CSS, React/Vue/NestJs) and learn and master some new ones (Python) or learn popular frameworks (Spring, React).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on big and complex projects to further improve my programming skills. While web development is a familiar domain I'm open to diversity in terms of workplace tasks.
