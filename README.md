### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Darius Teodor Rus 

I am a 3rd year student at UTCN, ETTI.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my programming skills. 
        This, in a very broad way, means everything from algorithmic thinking for diverse problems to different programming languages and frameworks.

        Because of my particular interest in games, interfaces and functional programming I created a few simple games such as Snake (basic JS), Pong (Java), MazeGame (Java), Sudoku(Java). 
        Currently I'm working on better versions and other games such as a platformer.

        In terms of problem solving, I regularly solve coding problems on CodeWars, an online coding practice site for all programmers where you can learn various programming languages and develop a good understanding of algorithms and problem solving.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to be more advanced in known languages (Java, JavaScript, C/C++, SQL, HTML/CSS) and learn and master some new ones (Python) or learn popular frameworks (Spring, React).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on big and complex projects to further improve my programming skills. 
        Internships are a current goal and/or part-time after a good introduction to the working enviroment and it's requirements.
